A ROS interface library for the Franka Emika Panda robot, extending the [franka-ros][franka-ros] to expose more information about the robot, and
providing low-level control of the robot using ROS and [Python API][fri-doc].

Franka ROS Interface provides utilites for controlling and managing the Franka Emika Panda robot (real and [simulated][ps-repo]. Contains exposed controllers for the robot (joint position,
velocity, torque), interfaces for the gripper, controller manager, coordinate frames interface, etc. Also provides utilities to control the robot using MoveIt! and ROS Trajectory Action & ActionClient. This package also provides almost complete sim-to-real / real-to-sim transfer of code with the [panda_simulator][ps-repo] package.

Documentation Page: https://justagist.github.io/franka_ros_interface

**This branch requires franka_ros release versions 0.7.0, 0.7.1.** [![franka_ros_version](https://img.shields.io/badge/franka_ros-v0.7.1%20release-yellow.svg)](https://github.com/frankaemika/franka_ros/tree/49e5ac1055e332581b4520a1bd9ac8aaf4580fb1)

A more unified ROS Python interface built over this package is available at [PandaRobot](https://github.com/justagist/panda_robot), which provides a more intuitive interface class that combines the different API classes in this package. Simple demos are also available.

## Features

- Low-level *controllers* (joint position, velocity, torque, impedance) available that can be controlled through ROS topics and Python API (including position control for gripper).
- Real-time *robot state* (end-effector state, joint state, controller state, etc.) available through ROS topics and Python API.
- Python API for managing controllers, coordinate frames, collision behaviour, controlling and monitoring the gripper.
- Python API classes and utility functions to control the robot using MoveIt! and ROS Trajectory Action Service.
- The [panda_simulator][ps-repo] package (which is Gazebo-based simulator for the robot) can also be controlled using this package (ROS and Python interface), providing almost complete sim-to-real transfer of code.

## Installation

ROS Melodic: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/justagist/franka_ros_interface.svg?branch=v0.7.1)](https://travis-ci.org/justagist/franka_ros_interface)

**NOTE:** *Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 with ROS Melodic with franka_ros version 0.7.1 (release). Version for ROS Kinetic requires franka_ros v0.6.0; check the 'v0.6.0' branch of this repo. The latest updates to the package may not be compatible with Kinetic.*

### Dependencies

- *libfranka* (`sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-libfranka` or [install from source][libfranka-doc]). *Make sure to use the release version if building from source.*
- *franka-ros* v0.7.1 (`sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-franka-ros` or [install from source][libfranka-doc]). *Make sure to use the [release version](https://github.com/frankaemika/franka_ros/tree/902fdbba0f7c6036a84a688712a454b9e622863b) if building from source. (`git checkout 902fdbb` from the cloned franka_ros github repo.)*
- (optional, but recommended) [*franka_panda_description*][fpd-repo] (See [Related Packages](#related-packages) section for information about package). **NOTE**: If you do not want to use the *franka_panda_description* package, make sure you modify the `franka_interface/launch/interface.launch` file and replace all occurences of `franka_panda_description` with
   `franka_description` (two occurences).

Once the above dependencies are installed, the package can be installed using catkin:

```sh
   cd <catkin_ws>
   git clone https://github.com/justagist/franka_ros_interface src/franka_ros_interface
   catkin build franka_ros_interface # or catkin_make
   source devel/setup.bash
```

After building the package:

- Copy/move the *franka.sh* file to the root of the catkin_ws `$ cp src/franka_ros_interface/franka.sh ./`
- Change the values in the copied file (described in the file).

## Usage

The 'driver' node can be started by running (can only be used if run in 'master' environment - see [Environments](#the-frankash-environments) section below):

```sh
    roslaunch franka_interface interface.launch # (use argument load_gripper:=false for starting without gripper)
```

Available keyword arguments for launch file:

- `load_gripper`: start driver node with the Franka gripper (default: `true`).
- `start_controllers`: load the available controllers to the controller manager (default: `true`).
- `start_moveit`: start moveit server along with the driver node (default: `true`).
- `load_demo_planning_scene`: loads a default planning scene for MoveIt planning with simple objects for collision avoidance (default: `true`). See [create_demo_planning_scene.py](franka_moveit/scripts/create_demo_planning_scene.py).

This starts the robot controllers and drivers to expose a variety of ROS topics and services for communicating with and controlling the robot. The robot's measurements and controllers can be accessed using ROS topics and services (see below to find out about some of the available topics and services), or using the provided [Python API][fri-doc] (also see [*PandaRobot*](https://github.com/justagist/panda_robot)).

Basic usage of the API is shown in the [`test_robot.py` example file](franka_interface/tests/test_robot.py).
See [documentation][fri-doc] for all available methods and functionalities. More usage examples can be found in the [PandaRobot](https://github.com/justagist/panda_robot).

### The *franka.sh* environments

Once the values are correctly modified in the `franka.sh` file, different environments can be set for controlling the robot by sourcing this file.

- For instance, running `./franka.sh master` would start an environment assuming that the computer is directly connected to the robot (requires Real-Time kernel set up as described in the [FCI documentation][libfranka-doc]).
- On the other hand, `./franka.sh remote` would start an environment assuming that the robot is not connected directly to the computer, but to another computer in the network (whose IP must be specified in *franka.sh*). This way, if the 'master' is connected to the robot and running the driver node (see below), the 'remote' can control the robot (**no need for Real Time kernel!**) as long as they are in the same network.
- ~Simulation environment can be started by running `./franka.sh sim` (only required when using [panda_simulator][ps-repo] package).~

#### Some useful ROS topics

##### Published Topics:
| ROS Topic | Data |
| ------ | ------ |
| */franka_ros_interface/custom_franka_state_controller/robot_state* | gravity, coriolis, jacobian, cartesian velocity, etc. |
| */franka_ros_interface/custom_franka_state_controller/tip_state* | end-effector pose, wrench, etc. |
| */franka_ros_interface/joint_states* | joint positions, velocities, efforts |
| */franka_ros_interface/franka_gripper/joint_states* | joint positions, velocities, efforts of gripper joints |

##### Subscribed Topics:
| ROS Topic | Data |
| ------ | ------ |
| */franka_ros_interface/motion_controller/arm/joint_commands* | command the robot using the currently active controller |
| */franka_ros_interface/franka_gripper/[move/grasp/stop/homing]* | (action msg) command the joints of the gripper |

Other topics for changing the controller gains (also dynamically configurable), command timeout, etc. are also available.

#### ROS Services:
Controller manager service can be used to switch between all available controllers (joint position, velocity, effort). Gripper joints can be controlled using the ROS ActionClient. Other services for changing coordinate frames, adding gripper load configuration, etc. are also available.

#### Python API

Most of the above services and topics are wrapped using simple Python classes or utility functions, providing more control and simplicity. This includes direct control of the robot and gripper using the provided controllers. Refer README files in individual subpackages.
